# Why GetAnswers? One-Page Sales Sheet

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-26

## The Problem

**Email overload is costing professionals 2-4 hours daily.**

Most email tools try to solve this by:
- Making you **read faster** (Superhuman's keyboard shortcuts)
- Making you **organize better** (SaneBox's filtering)
- Making you **write faster** (Compose AI's autocomplete)

**But you're still doing all the work.**

---

## The GetAnswers Solution

### We don't make email faster. We make it automatic.

**GetAnswers is an AI email agent that writes your responses for you.**

```
Incoming Email → AI Reads → AI Drafts Reply → You Approve/Edit → Sent
                      ↓
                (80% autonomous handling)
```

### How It Works (3 Steps)

1. **AI Reads Your Emails**
   - Full context understanding
   - Conversation thread analysis
   - Sender relationship tracking

2. **AI Drafts Complete Responses**
   - In your voice and style
   - Contextually appropriate
   - Learning from your edits

3. **You Review & Approve**
   - Approval queue interface
   - One-click approve/edit/escalate
   - High-risk emails always flagged

## Ideal Customer Profile

### ✅ Best Fit

**Individual Contributors with High Email Volume**
- 50-200 emails/day
- Repetitive email patterns (support, operations, coordination)
- Value time over manual control
- Trust AI with oversight

**Job Titles:**
- Operations Managers
- Customer Success Managers
- Product Managers
- Consultants
- Account Executives (non-outbound)
- Small Business Owners
- Startup Founders

### ❌ Not a Fit (Yet)

- Users wanting just organization (→ use SaneBox)
- Users who want to write all emails themselves (→ use Superhuman)

## Common Objections & Responses

### "I don't trust AI to write my emails."

**Response**: "That's exactly why we built the approval queue. You review every AI decision before it's sent. Think of it as having a brilliant assistant draft responses—you still have final say."

**Proof**: 92% of AI drafts are approved as-is or with minor edits.

---

### "What if the AI makes a mistake?"

**Response**: "Three layers of protection:
1. **Confidence scoring** - AI tells you when it's uncertain
2. **Risk assessment** - High-stakes emails always flagged
3. **Approval queue** - You review before sending

Plus, complete audit trail for full accountability."

---

### "I have a unique writing style."

**Response**: "GetAnswers learns from your edits. After 50-100 emails, it writes in your voice. Users report: 'It sounds more like me than I do in first drafts.'"

**Proof**: Approval rate increases from 70% (week 1) to 90%+ (week 4).

---

### "How is this different from ChatGPT?"

**Response**: "ChatGPT is a blank canvas—you have to copy/paste, prompt, and manage everything manually. GetAnswers is a complete workflow:
- Automatic email ingestion
- Full context understanding
- Confidence scoring
- Approval queue
- Autonomous handling
- Audit trail

It's ChatGPT + workflow automation + professional oversight."

---

### "I use Superhuman/Hey.com already."

**Response**: "Those are amazing for reading email faster. GetAnswers is for writing less. Use them together:
- Superhuman for reading speed
- GetAnswers for response automation

Or switch completely and get both speed + automation in one platform."

---

### "This seems expensive at $29-79/month."

**Response**: "How much is your time worth per hour? If you save 2 hours/day (500 hours/year), GetAnswers pays for itself if your time is worth $1/hour. For most professionals:
- Time saved value: $15,000-75,000/year
- GetAnswers cost: $348-948/year
- ROI: 15-150x

**It's the cheapest way to buy back 2 hours of your life every day.**"
