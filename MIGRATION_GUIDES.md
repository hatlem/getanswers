## From Superhuman

### What You're Losing
- Native email client (you'll use GetAnswers web app)
- Some keyboard shortcuts (we have our own)
- Read receipts and tracking

### What You're Gaining
- **AI writes all your emails** (vs you writing them faster)
- **Approval queue workflow** (vs manual composition)
- **80%+ autonomous handling** (vs 100% manual)
- **2+ hours saved daily** (vs 30-60 min saved)

### Migration Steps

**Week 1: Parallel Use**
1. Keep Superhuman for reading email quickly
2. Add GetAnswers for Gmail/Outlook connection
3. Let GetAnswers draft responses
4. Use Superhuman to send if you prefer

**Week 2: GetAnswers Primary**
1. Use GetAnswers approval queue as main workflow
2. Keep Superhuman for occasional quick reads
3. Set autonomy levels in GetAnswers

**Week 3+: Full Switch (Optional)**
1. Cancel Superhuman or keep both
2. Use GetAnswers for 90%+ of email
3. Total cost: $29-79/mo (same or less than Superhuman's $30/mo)

### Feature Translation

| Superhuman Feature | GetAnswers Equivalent |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Cmd+K (command palette) | Approval queue actions |
| Split inbox | AI-categorized views |
| Reminders | Follow-up tracking |
| Snippets | AI learns your responses |
| Speed | Automation (even faster) |

### Pro Tip
**Use both together**: Superhuman for reading, GetAnswers for writing. Cancel one after you see which you prefer.

## From SaneBox

### What You're Losing
- Folder-based organization (SaneLater, SaneNews, etc.)
- Email digest summaries
- Attachment reminders

### What You're Gaining
- **AI actually responds to emails** (vs just filtering them)
- **Complete response generation** (vs still writing manually)
- **Approval queue** (vs email folders)
- **Time savings**: 2+ hours vs 30 min

### Migration Steps

**Week 1: Add GetAnswers**
1. Keep SaneBox running
2. Connect GetAnswers to same email account
3. Let GetAnswers draft responses
4. SaneBox still handles filtering

**Week 2: Reduce SaneBox Scope**
1. Turn off SaneBox for high-priority folders
2. Let GetAnswers handle those emails end-to-end
3. Keep SaneBox for newsletters/low-priority

**Week 3+: Decision Point**
1. **Keep SaneBox**: If you like folder organization ($7-36/mo + $29-79/mo GetAnswers)
2. **Cancel SaneBox**: If approval queue replaces folders (save $7-36/mo)

### Feature Translation

| SaneBox Feature | GetAnswers Equivalent |
|----------------|----------------------|
| SaneLater folder | Low-priority queue |
| SaneNews folder | Newsletter handling |
| Filtering rules | AI categorization |
