## Battlecard: vs Superhuman

### Quick Facts
| | Superhuman | GetAnswers |
|---|------------|------------|
| **Price** | $30/mo | $29-79/mo |
| **Category** | Email client | AI email agent |
| **Time Saved** | 30-60 min/day | 2+ hours/day |
| **Your Work** | Write every email (faster) | Just approve AI drafts |

### Discovery Questions

**Ask prospect:**
- "What do you love about Superhuman?"
  - Listen for: Speed, keyboard shortcuts, clean UI
- "How much time do you spend *writing* emails each day?"
  - Listen for: 1-3 hours (this is your opening)
- "If you could save 2 more hours per day, what would that be worth?"
  - Calculate ROI live

### Positioning Statement

**"Superhuman makes you faster at email. GetAnswers makes email automatic."**

### Key Differentiators

✅ **AI Writes Responses**
- **Them**: You write every email (just faster with shortcuts)
- **Us**: AI writes complete responses, you approve in one click
- **Demo**: Show approval queue vs composing

✅ **Autonomous Handling**
- **Them**: 100% manual, even with speed UI
- **Us**: 80%+ emails handled without your intervention
- **Demo**: Show autonomy settings

✅ **Time Savings**
- **Them**: 30-60 minutes/day saved
- **Us**: 2+ hours/day saved
- **Proof**: "They make you type faster. We eliminate typing."

### What They'll Say

**Objection**: "I love Superhuman's speed and keyboard shortcuts."

**Response**: "Totally understand—Superhuman is amazing for reading email quickly. Here's the question: once you've read the email, who writes the response? With Superhuman, you do. With GetAnswers, AI does. Which would save you more time?"

**Then ask**: "What if you could use both? Superhuman for reading, GetAnswers for writing?"

---

**Objection**: "I don't trust AI to write my emails."

**Response**: "That's why we built the approval queue. Same concept as Superhuman's inbox—you review everything before it sends. But instead of writing from scratch, you're reviewing AI drafts. 92% of our users approve with zero edits."

**Demo**: Show confidence scoring and risk assessment

---

**Objection**: "Superhuman is only $30/month, GetAnswers is more."

**Response**: "Fair point. Let's do the math: If your time is worth $50/hour and GetAnswers saves you an extra 1.5 hours per day vs Superhuman (conservative estimate), that's $75/day or ~$1,500/month in value. So $79/month for GetAnswers Pro is a 19x ROI. Even Starter at $29/month is basically free."

**Then ask**: "What's your hourly rate? Let me show you the ROI..."

### Closing Strategy

**Use Both Approach**:
"Try this: Keep Superhuman for the next 2 weeks. Add GetAnswers (free trial, no credit card). Use Superhuman for reading, GetAnswers for responding. At the end of 2 weeks, you can cancel one, keep both, or switch entirely. Zero risk."

**Migration Offer**:
"We'll match your remaining Superhuman subscription. If you have 6 months left, we'll give you 6 months free GetAnswers."

## Battlecard: vs SaneBox

### Quick Facts
| | SaneBox | GetAnswers |
|---|---------|------------|
| **Price** | $7-36/mo | $29-79/mo |
| **Category** | Email filtering | AI email agent |
| **Function** | Sorts emails into folders | Drafts complete responses |
| **Your Work** | Read filtered inbox, write responses | Approve AI drafts |

### Discovery Questions

**Ask prospect:**
- "What problem does SaneBox solve for you?"
  - Listen for: Too many emails, need organization
- "After SaneBox filters your email, what happens next?"
  - Listen for: "I still have to respond to them" ← BINGO
- "How much time do you spend writing email responses each day?"
  - Listen for: 1-3 hours (this is your opening)

### Positioning Statement

**"SaneBox filters your inbox. GetAnswers responds to it."**

### Key Differentiators

✅ **Response Generation**
- **Them**: Organizes emails into folders (you still write everything)
- **Us**: AI writes complete responses (you just approve)
- **Demo**: Show how AI drafts responses, not just filters

✅ **End-to-End Automation**
- **Them**: Filtering only (incomplete solution)
- **Us**: Triage + draft + send workflow
- **Proof**: "They solve 30% of the problem. We solve 90%."

✅ **Time Savings**
- **Them**: 30 minutes/day saved (less time finding emails)
- **Us**: 2+ hours/day saved (less time writing emails)
- **ROI**: Much higher value for slightly higher cost

### What They'll Say

**Objection**: "SaneBox is way cheaper at $7/month."

**Response**: "Absolutely, and it's great for what it does—filtering. But here's the thing: after SaneBox filters your inbox, you still spend 2-3 hours writing responses. GetAnswers saves you those 2-3 hours. If your time is worth $50/hour, that's $100-150/day in value. So $29/month is basically free."

**Then ask**: "Are you trying to spend less time *finding* emails or less time *responding* to emails?"

---

**Objection**: "I need the folder organization SaneBox provides."

**Response**: "Good news—you can use both! SaneBox for folder filtering ($7-36/mo), GetAnswers for AI responses ($29-79/mo). Together they're still cheaper than your time. Or try GetAnswers' AI categorization for 14 days and see if it replaces your folder workflow."

**Demo**: Show approval queue categories (similar to folders, but smarter)

---

**Objection**: "I like SaneBox's digests for low-priority emails."

**Response**: "We have something similar—our low-priority queue. But instead of getting a digest of emails you need to respond to, you get a digest of *AI-drafted responses* you can approve in bulk. Which would you rather review—20 emails or 20 ready-to-send responses?"

### Closing Strategy

**Complementary Approach**:
"Start GetAnswers trial while keeping SaneBox. Use SaneBox for filtering, GetAnswers for responding. After 14 days, decide if you need both or if GetAnswers' AI categorization replaces SaneBox's folders."

**ROI Calculator**:
"SaneBox saves you 30 minutes/day. GetAnswers saves you 2+ hours/day. The price difference is $22-43/month. If your time is worth $11/hour or more, GetAnswers pays for itself. What's your hourly rate?"

## Battlecard: vs Ellie

### Quick Facts
| | Ellie | GetAnswers |
|---|-------|------------|
| **Price** | ~$19-39/mo | $29-79/mo |
| **Platform** | Chrome extension | Full web platform |
| **Workflow** | Copy AI suggestions into Gmail | Approval queue with one-click actions |
| **Features** | AI replies | AI replies + confidence + risk + audit + autonomous |

### Discovery Questions

**Ask prospect:**
- "How do you currently use Ellie?"
  - Listen for: "I copy suggestions into Gmail"
- "What do you like about it? What's frustrating?"
  - Listen for: Manual copy/paste, no confidence scores
- "How often do you edit Ellie's suggestions before sending?"
  - Listen for: Frequently (shows they need confidence scoring)

### Positioning Statement

**"Ellie generates AI replies. GetAnswers manages your entire inbox with an approval queue."**

### Key Differentiators

✅ **Approval Queue Workflow**
- **Them**: Copy AI suggestion from sidebar into Gmail compose
- **Us**: One-click approve/edit/escalate in dedicated queue
- **Demo**: Show workflow difference side-by-side

✅ **Confidence Scoring**
- **Them**: No way to know if AI is certain or guessing
- **Us**: 0-100% confidence score on every draft
- **Proof**: "Know which emails to review carefully vs approve instantly"

✅ **Autonomous Handling**
- **Them**: Every email requires manual action
- **Us**: 80%+ emails auto-handled based on your settings
- **Demo**: Show autonomy levels and VIP exceptions

✅ **Multi-Provider Support**
- **Them**: Gmail only (Chrome extension)
- **Us**: Gmail, Outlook, custom SMTP (full platform)
- **Proof**: "Works with all your email accounts"

### What They'll Say

**Objection**: "Ellie is cheaper at $19/month."

**Response**: "Fair, but let's talk about what you get for that extra $10-60/month:
- Approval queue (vs copy/paste)
- Confidence scoring (know when AI is uncertain)
- Autonomous handling (80%+ emails auto-sent)
- Risk assessment (high-stakes emails flagged)
- Complete audit trail
- Multi-provider support

If those features save you even 30 more minutes per month, the ROI is 10x. Sound worth it?"

---

**Objection**: "I like Ellie's Chrome extension—it's convenient."

**Response**: "I hear you. Question: how many times per day do you copy AI text from Ellie's sidebar into Gmail? Now imagine instead of copying, you just click 'Approve' once. Which is more convenient?"

**Demo**: Show approval queue workflow vs extension workflow

---

**Objection**: "Ellie's AI quality is good enough."

**Response**: "The AI quality might be similar—both use advanced language models. The difference is workflow and features. With Ellie, good AI suggestions still require manual handling. With GetAnswers, good AI drafts go out automatically. It's not about better AI, it's about better workflow."

**Then ask**: "What would you do with 2 extra hours per day?"

### Closing Strategy

**Direct Switch**:
"Cancel Ellie, start GetAnswers 14-day trial (no credit card). If you don't see the approval queue as a massive upgrade, go back to Ellie. But I bet you won't want to go back to copy/paste."

**Extended Trial Offer**:
"Show me your Ellie receipt and I'll give you 30 days free trial (vs standard 14). Plenty of time to see the difference."

## Battlecard: vs Compose AI

### Quick Facts
| | Compose AI | GetAnswers |
|---|------------|------------|
| **Price** | Free-$10/mo | $29-79/mo |
| **Category** | Autocomplete tool | AI email agent |
| **Function** | Suggests next sentences as you type | Drafts complete email responses |
| **Scope** | Works everywhere (email, docs, Slack) | Email-focused (higher quality) |

### Discovery Questions

**Ask prospect:**
- "What do you use Compose AI for?"
  - Listen for: Email, other writing, everywhere
- "If you only used it for email, would you still pay for it?"
  - Listen for: Maybe not (opening for specialization)
- "How much time do you save with autocomplete vs if you didn't write the email at all?"
  - Listen for: Realization that autocomplete is incremental, not transformational

### Positioning Statement

**"Compose AI makes you faster at typing emails. GetAnswers eliminates typing emails entirely."**

### Key Differentiators

✅ **Complete Response Generation**
- **Them**: Autocomplete suggestions as you type
- **Us**: Full email response ready to send
- **Demo**: Show typing with autocomplete vs instant complete draft

✅ **Email-Focused Platform**
- **Them**: General autocomplete for all writing
- **Us**: Email-specific with context, threads, relationships
- **Proof**: "Specialization = higher quality for email use case"

✅ **Workflow Automation**
- **Them**: You still compose each email (just faster)
- **Us**: Approval queue + autonomous handling
- **ROI**: 2+ hours saved vs 30 minutes saved

### What They'll Say

**Objection**: "Compose AI has a free tier, GetAnswers doesn't."

**Response**: "True! Compose AI is great for casual use. Question for you: how much is your time worth? If you spend 2 hours/day on email and Compose AI saves you 30 minutes (generous estimate), that's still 1.5 hours wasted. GetAnswers saves you the full 2 hours.

At $29/month for Starter, that's ~$1/day. If your time is worth more than $1/hour, GetAnswers pays for itself immediately. What's your hourly rate?"

---

**Objection**: "I use Compose AI for more than just email."

**Response**: "Perfect! Keep using Compose AI for docs, Slack, and other writing ($10/mo). Add GetAnswers specifically for email ($29-79/mo). Total cost: $39-89/mo for both. Or try GetAnswers for 14 days and see if you even need Compose AI for email anymore."

**Then say**: "Most of our users who switched from Compose AI say they don't miss the autocomplete—complete responses are way better than sentence suggestions."

---

**Objection**: "Autocomplete while typing feels natural."

**Response**: "I get it. But here's the thing: with GetAnswers, you don't type at all. Instead of:
1. Start typing → 2. Accept autocomplete → 3. Keep typing → 4. Send

You do:
1. Click approve → Done

Which feels more natural: Faster typing or no typing?"

**Demo**: Show approval queue workflow with one-click actions

### Closing Strategy

**Keep Both Approach**:
"Start GetAnswers trial for email. Keep Compose AI for everything else. After 14 days:
- If you love GetAnswers: Cancel Compose AI for email, save time
- If you don't: Cancel GetAnswers, keep Compose AI
Zero risk to try both."

**Professional Upgrade**:
"Compose AI is great for individuals and casual use. GetAnswers is built for professionals who get 100+ emails/day. If email is a big part of your job, you need professional tooling."

## Battlecard: vs Hey.com

### Quick Facts
| | Hey.com | GetAnswers |
|---|---------|------------|
| **Price** | $99/year ($8/mo) | $29-79/mo |
| **Email Address** | New @hey.com address required | Use existing address |
| **Category** | Opinionated email platform | AI email agent |
| **Philosophy** | Email reimagined | Email automated |

### Discovery Questions

**Ask prospect:**
- "What do you love about Hey.com?"
  - Listen for: Screener, Feed, workflows, philosophy
- "Do you miss anything from your old Gmail/Outlook?"
  - Listen for: Integrations, familiarity, existing address
- "After Hey's screener and organization, who writes the actual email responses?"
  - Listen for: "I do" ← BINGO

### Positioning Statement

**"Hey.com optimizes your email workflow. GetAnswers automates it with AI."**

### Key Differentiators

✅ **Keep Your Email Address**
- **Them**: Requires new @hey.com address (migration pain)
- **Us**: Works with your existing Gmail/Outlook address
- **Proof**: "No need to change your email address or notify contacts"

✅ **AI Response Generation**
- **Them**: Beautiful workflows, but you write every email
- **Us**: AI writes responses, you just approve
- **Demo**: Show approval queue vs Hey's manual workflow

✅ **Autonomous Handling**
- **Them**: Manual triage and response (even with screener)
- **Us**: 80%+ emails handled automatically
- **ROI**: 2+ hours saved vs Hey's organizational benefits

### What They'll Say

**Objection**: "Hey.com is way cheaper at $99/year."

**Response**: "Absolutely, Hey is great value for what it does. But let's compare apples to apples:

Hey: $99/year for better email organization
GetAnswers: $348-948/year for AI writing all your emails

If your time is worth $50/hour and GetAnswers saves you 2 hours/day (vs 30 minutes with Hey), that's $25,000/year in value vs $348-948 cost. That's a 26-71x ROI.

Is saving $249-849/year worth losing 500 hours/year?"

---

**Objection**: "I love Hey's opinionated UX and philosophy."

**Response**: "I totally get it—Hey is beautifully designed with strong opinions about email. Here's the thing: you can have both philosophies:
- Hey's philosophy: Email should be intentional and organized
- GetAnswers' philosophy: Email should be automated by AI

They're compatible! Use both: Hey for organization ($99/yr), GetAnswers for automation ($348-948/yr). Or try GetAnswers for 14 days and see if AI automation is an even better philosophy."

---

**Objection**: "I don't want to change my email address again."

**Response**: "Great news—you don't have to! GetAnswers works with your existing email. If you're on @hey.com now and want to switch back to Gmail, we can help with that transition. Or connect @hey.com to GetAnswers via IMAP/SMTP and keep your Hey address."

### Closing Strategy

**Compatible Approach**:
"Hey and GetAnswers aren't competitors—they solve different problems. Hey organizes, GetAnswers responds. Try both:
- Hey: $99/year
- GetAnswers: $348-948/year
- Total: ~$450-1,050/year for ultimate setup

Or try GetAnswers solo for 14 days and see if AI automation replaces your need for Hey's workflows."

**Email Address Liberation**:
"If you've been wanting to switch back to Gmail but the workflow downgrade stopped you, GetAnswers gives you better workflows than Hey *plus* AI automation. Win-win."

## Battlecard: vs Lavender

### Quick Facts
| | Lavender | GetAnswers |
|---|----------|------------|
| **Price** | ~$29+/mo | $29-79/mo |
| **Focus** | Sales email coaching | General email automation |
| **Function** | Coaches you to write better sales emails | Writes all emails for you |
| **Best For** | Sales teams doing cold outreach | Everyone doing email (non-outbound) |

### Discovery Questions

**Ask prospect:**
- "What percentage of your email is sales outreach vs everything else?"
  - If >80% outreach: "Keep Lavender, it's better for that"
  - If <50% outreach: "You're paying for sales features you don't need"
- "Besides cold outreach, how much time do you spend on other email?"
  - Listen for: Support, internal, follow-ups, operations
- "Do you want coaching to write better, or do you want AI to write for you?"
  - Listen for: Preference for automation vs coaching

### Positioning Statement

**"Lavender coaches you to write better sales emails. GetAnswers writes all your emails for you."**

### Key Differentiators

✅ **General-Purpose Email**
- **Them**: Sales-focused (cold outreach, prospecting)
- **Us**: All email types (support, ops, internal, follow-ups)
- **Proof**: "If <80% of your email is sales, you're overpaying for sales features"

✅ **Automation vs Coaching**
- **Them**: Coaches you to improve your writing
- **Us**: Writes for you (no coaching needed)
- **Demo**: Show complete response generation vs coaching overlay

✅ **Use Case Fit**
- **Them**: Best for SDRs, AEs doing high-volume cold outbound
- **Us**: Best for everyone else (CSMs, PMs, ops, founders, consultants)
- **Recommendation**: Can use both for different use cases

### What They'll Say

**Objection**: "Lavender helps me write better sales emails."

**Response**: "Totally! Lavender is great for that. Question: what percentage of your email is cold sales outreach vs everything else (existing customers, internal, support, follow-ups)?

If it's 50/50, you're paying for sales features for only half your email. Use Lavender for cold outbound, GetAnswers for everything else. Best of both worlds."

---

**Objection**: "I need the personalization insights for prospecting."

**Response**: "100% agree—for cold prospecting, Lavender's personalization coaching is valuable. Keep using it for that! Add GetAnswers for:
- Existing customer communication
- Internal team coordination
- Follow-ups and support
- Non-sales email

Most professionals spend 50-70% of time on non-sales email. Let Lavender coach your sales emails, let GetAnswers automate everything else."

---

**Objection**: "Lavender and GetAnswers are the same price."

**Response**: "Similar price, different value prop:
- Lavender: Helps you write better sales emails (you still write them)
- GetAnswers: Writes all emails for you (you just approve)

If you're in sales doing cold outreach: Keep Lavender
If you're anyone else: GetAnswers is better
If you do both: Use both for different email types"

### Closing Strategy

**Segmented Approach**:
"Here's what most users do:
- Keep Lavender for cold outbound to prospects ($29+/mo)
- Add GetAnswers for existing customers, internal, support ($29-79/mo)
- Total: $58-108/mo for complete email coverage

Or use GetAnswers solo if <50% of your email is sales outreach."

**Role-Based**:
- "If you're an SDR/AE doing mostly outbound: Stick with Lavender"
- "If you're CSM/PM/Ops/Founder: Switch to GetAnswers"
- "If you're a full-cycle AE: Use both"

## Battlecard: vs Gmail/Outlook Native

### Quick Facts
| | Gmail/Outlook Native | GetAnswers |
|---|----------------------|------------|
| **Price** | Free (or Office 365 cost) | $29-79/mo |
| **AI Features** | Smart Reply (3-5 word suggestions) | Complete AI-generated responses |
| **Autonomy** | None (every email is manual) | 80%+ emails auto-handled |

### Discovery Questions

**Ask prospect:**
- "How many emails do you get per day?"
  - Listen for: 50-200+ (high volume = good fit)
- "How much time do you spend on email daily?"
  - Listen for: 2-4 hours (quantify time waste)
- "Have you tried Gmail's Smart Reply? Why don't you use it?"
  - Listen for: Too simple, not useful, only 3 words

### Positioning Statement

**"Gmail/Outlook handle email. GetAnswers eliminates email work."**

### Key Differentiators

✅ **Complete Response Generation**
- **Them**: Smart Reply = "Thanks!" "Sounds good!" "Got it!"
- **Us**: Full contextual responses (5-10 sentences)
- **Demo**: Show Smart Reply vs GetAnswers draft side-by-side

✅ **Approval Queue Workflow**
- **Them**: Manual composition for every email
- **Us**: Review queue of AI drafts with one-click actions
- **Proof**: "We're not replacing Gmail/Outlook, we're adding AI automation on top"

✅ **Autonomous Handling**
- **Them**: Zero automation (every email is manual work)
- **Us**: 80%+ emails handled without your intervention
- **ROI**: 2+ hours saved daily

### What They'll Say

**Objection**: "Gmail/Outlook is free (or included in Office 365)."

**Response**: "Absolutely, and you'll keep using Gmail/Outlook! GetAnswers doesn't replace them—it adds AI automation on top.

Think of it this way:
- Gmail/Outlook: Free email storage and delivery
- GetAnswers: $29-79/mo for 2 hours/day time savings

If your time is worth $15/hour or more, GetAnswers pays for itself immediately. What's your hourly rate?"

---

**Objection**: "Google/Microsoft will add AI features eventually."

**Response**: "You're probably right—they will. But here's what they won't do:
1. Autonomous handling (too risky for mainstream)
2. Approval queue (not their UX model)
3. Confidence scoring (too complex for average user)
4. Professional oversight (they optimize for simplicity)

Gmail/Outlook will add AI suggestions (they already have Smart Reply). GetAnswers is a complete AI agent platform. By the time they catch up, we'll be years ahead."

**Then say**: "Would you rather wait 2-3 years for Gmail's AI or save 2 hours/day starting today?"

---

**Objection**: "I'm used to Gmail/Outlook and don't want to change."

**Response**: "Perfect! You don't have to change. GetAnswers connects to your existing Gmail/Outlook account. You still use Gmail/Outlook for reading, organizing, searching—everything you're used to. GetAnswers just adds an approval queue for AI-drafted responses.

Zero disruption, massive time savings."

**Demo**: Show how GetAnswers integrates with Gmail/Outlook (doesn't replace)

### Closing Strategy

**Add-On Approach**:
"You'll keep Gmail/Outlook for free. GetAnswers is an add-on that gives you:
- AI response generation
- Approval queue
- Autonomous handling
- 2+ hours/day time savings

Think of it like Gmail + autopilot for $29-79/mo. Worth it?"

**Risk-Free Trial**:
"14-day free trial, no credit card. Connect your Gmail/Outlook and see if AI drafts are as good as I'm saying. If not, cancel and you've lost nothing."

## Universal Objection Handlers

### "AI isn't good enough to write my emails."

**Response**: "Fair concern. Let me ask: have you tried Claude, GPT-4, or other modern AI for email responses?"

If YES: "Then you know the quality is there. The question is workflow. GetAnswers adds confidence scoring, risk assessment, and approval queue so you trust the AI."

If NO: "14-day free trial. If the AI quality isn't excellent, cancel. But I bet you'll be surprised—92% of our users approve drafts as-is or with minor edits."

---

### "This seems expensive."

**Response**: "Let's do the ROI math together. Three questions:
1. What's your hourly rate? (salary ÷ 2000)
2. How much time do you spend on email daily? (usually 2-3 hours)
3. How much would you save with GetAnswers? (usually 2+ hours)

[Calculate: Hours saved × hourly rate × 20 workdays = monthly value]

If GetAnswers costs $29-79/mo and saves you $X/month in time, is that worth it?"

**Example**: $60/hr × 2 hours/day × 20 days = $2,400/month value for $29-79/mo cost = 30-82x ROI

---

### "I need to think about it."

**Response**: "Of course! What specifically do you need to think about? Is it:
- Price/budget?
- AI quality/trust?
- Switching from current tool?
- Getting team buy-in?

[Address specific concern]

Or here's an idea: Start the 14-day free trial while you think about it. No credit card, zero commitment. Worst case, you've tested it. Best case, you've saved 28 hours in 2 weeks."

---

### "My company won't pay for this."

**Response**: "Got it. Few options:

**Option 1**: Pay personally ($29-79/mo from own pocket)
- If you make $60k+/year, the time savings justify personal expense
- Write it off as professional development

**Option 2**: Request budget with ROI justification
- We have a template email you can send to your manager
- Show: $X/month cost, $Y/month time savings value

**Option 3**: 14-day trial to prove value
- Start trial, track time saved, show results to manager
- Request budget after proving ROI

Which sounds best?"

---

## Closing Techniques

### The Two-Path Close

"You have two options:
1. Keep spending 2-3 hours/day on email manually
2. Try GetAnswers free for 14 days and potentially save 500+ hours/year

Which would you prefer?"

---

### The Competitor Close

"You're paying $X/month for [competitor]. GetAnswers is $29-79/month. The question isn't cost, it's value. Which saves you more time:
- [Competitor]: [Their value prop]
- GetAnswers: AI writes all emails, you approve

Let's find out. 14-day free trial, run them side by side."

---

### The Time Value Close

"Quick question: What would you do with 2 extra hours every day?

[Listen to answer]

That's what you're buying with GetAnswers—not just email automation, but 500+ hours/year to do [their answer]. Worth $29-79/month?"
