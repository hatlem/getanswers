## General Positioning

### Q: How is GetAnswers different from other email tools?

**A:** Most email tools fall into three categories:

1. **Email Clients** (Superhuman, Hey.com, Canary) - Make you faster at *writing* emails
2. **Organization Tools** (SaneBox, Boomerang) - Filter and organize your inbox
3. **AI Assistants** (Ellie, Compose AI) - Suggest replies or autocomplete

**GetAnswers is an AI Email Agent** - It actually writes your complete email responses. You just approve, edit, or escalate.

The key difference: **Other tools help you manage email. GetAnswers does it for you.**

---

### Q: Is this just autocomplete or smart replies?

**A:** No. GetAnswers generates **complete, contextual email responses** that are ready to send.

- **Not autocomplete** (like Compose AI) - Full responses, not sentence fragments
- **Not smart replies** (like Gmail) - Contextual, not generic "Thanks!" buttons
- **Not suggestions** (like Ellie) - Complete drafts with approval workflow

You review the draft in an approval queue and click approve, edit, or escalate. That's it.

---

### Q: What makes the approval queue workflow unique?

**A:** No other email tool has this workflow:

1. AI reads incoming emails
2. AI drafts complete responses
3. AI assesses confidence (0-100%) and risk (low/medium/high)
4. You review in dedicated approval queue
5. One-click: Approve → Edit → Escalate
6. High-confidence emails can be auto-sent (configurable)

**Competitors make you:**
- Superhuman: Write every email yourself (faster)
- SaneBox: Still write all emails after they're sorted
- Ellie: Copy/paste suggestions into Gmail
- Compose AI: Type emails with autocomplete help

**GetAnswers**: You approve or edit AI-generated drafts. 80%+ of emails handled autonomously.

---

## vs Superhuman

### Q: I already use Superhuman. Why would I switch?

**A:** Superhuman makes you faster at email. GetAnswers makes email automatic.

**Keep Superhuman if:**
- You love writing emails and want keyboard shortcuts
- You want to stay in control of every word
- You need the fastest email reading experience

**Switch to GetAnswers if:**
- You're tired of *writing* 50-200 emails/day
- You want AI to draft responses for you
- You'd rather approve than author

**Or use both**: Some customers use Superhuman for reading, GetAnswers for responding.

---

### Q: Superhuman is $30/month. GetAnswers is $29-79/month. How do you justify the price?

**A:** Different value propositions:

| | Superhuman | GetAnswers |
|---|------------|------------|
| **Price** | $30/mo | $29-79/mo |
| **What you get** | Fastest email client | AI writes your emails |
| **Time saved** | 30-60 min/day (typing faster) | 2+ hours/day (not typing at all) |
| **Your work** | Write every email | Approve/edit AI drafts |

**ROI Calculation:**
- GetAnswers at $79/mo = $948/year
- Time saved: 2 hours/day × 250 work days = 500 hours/year
- At $50/hr (conservative): **$25,000 value** for $948 cost = **26x ROI**

Superhuman makes you efficient. GetAnswers makes you autonomous.

---

### Q: Can I use GetAnswers with Superhuman?

**A:** Yes! Many customers use both:

- **Superhuman**: For reading email quickly with keyboard shortcuts
- **GetAnswers**: For responding with AI-drafted replies

They complement each other. Superhuman is a great email client. GetAnswers is an email agent.

---

## vs SaneBox

### Q: I use SaneBox to organize my inbox. Why would I need GetAnswers?

**A:** SaneBox filters emails into folders. GetAnswers responds to them.

**SaneBox** (organization):
- Filters low-priority emails into @SaneLater
- Reminds you to follow up
- Cleans up your inbox

**GetAnswers** (automation):
- Reads emails (organized or not)
- Drafts complete responses
- Handles 80%+ autonomously

**Use both**: SaneBox + GetAnswers work great together. SaneBox organizes, GetAnswers automates responses.

---

### Q: SaneBox is $7-36/month. GetAnswers is more expensive. Worth it?

**A:** Different problems solved:

- **SaneBox**: Reduces inbox clutter ($7-36/mo)
- **GetAnswers**: Eliminates response time ($29-79/mo)

If you spend 2+ hours daily *responding* to email (not just reading), GetAnswers saves significantly more time than SaneBox.

**ROI comparison:**
- SaneBox: Saves ~30 min/day organizing
- GetAnswers: Saves 2+ hours/day responding

For professionals making $50+/hour, GetAnswers pays for itself in the first hour of saved time each month.

---

## vs AI Email Tools

### Q: How is GetAnswers different from Ellie?

**A:** Ellie suggests AI replies in Gmail. GetAnswers manages your entire inbox.

| | Ellie | GetAnswers |
|---|-------|------------|
| **What it does** | Chrome extension with AI reply suggestions | Full email management platform |
| **Workflow** | You copy/paste suggestions into Gmail | Dedicated approval queue |
| **Confidence scoring** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (0-100%) |
| **Risk assessment** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (low/med/high) |
| **Autonomous handling** | ❌ No (manual for every email) | ✅ Yes (80%+ auto-sent) |
| **Multi-provider** | Gmail only | Gmail, Outlook, others |

**Bottom line**: Ellie is a helpful Gmail extension. GetAnswers is a full platform.

---

### Q: What about Compose AI? They have millions of users and a free tier.

**A:** Compose AI is autocomplete. GetAnswers is complete response generation.

**Compose AI:**
- AI-powered autocomplete as you type
- Free tier available (limited features)
- Helps you write emails faster
- You still write the email

**GetAnswers:**
- AI writes complete responses for you
- Premium product ($29-79/mo)
- Handles 80%+ of emails autonomously
- You just approve/edit

**Analogy**: Compose AI is like spell-check. GetAnswers is like having an assistant.

**When to use each:**
- **Compose AI**: You want to write your own emails but faster
- **GetAnswers**: You want AI to write emails for you

---

### Q: Ready to Send is a Gmail add-on. Why not just use that?

**A:** Ready to Send works *in* Gmail. GetAnswers works *across* all your email.

**Ready to Send** (Gmail add-on):
- ✅ Convenient Gmail integration
- ❌ Gmail only (no Outlook)
- ❌ No approval workflow
- ❌ No confidence scoring
- ❌ Manual workflow for every email

**GetAnswers** (Platform):
- ✅ Works with Gmail, Outlook, others
- ✅ Dedicated approval queue
- ✅ Confidence scoring & risk assessment
- ✅ Autonomous handling (80%+)
- ✅ Complete audit trail

**Bottom line**: Gmail add-on vs full email management platform.

---

## vs Hey.com

### Q: Hey.com is only $99/year ($8/month). How do you compete?

**A:** Hey.com is an opinionated email client. GetAnswers is AI automation.

**Hey.com:**
- Beautiful workflow (Screener, Feed, Paper Trail)
- Requires new @hey.com email address
- You still write all emails yourself
- Focus: Email as productivity tool

**GetAnswers:**
- AI writes your emails for you
- Works with existing Gmail/Outlook
- 80%+ autonomous handling
- Focus: Email as automation opportunity

**Price vs Value:**
- Hey.com: $99/year for better *workflow*
- GetAnswers: $348+/year for *automation*

If you spend 2+ hours daily writing emails, GetAnswers delivers 50x+ ROI. Hey.com optimizes workflow. GetAnswers eliminates work.

---

### Q: Can I use GetAnswers with my @hey.com address?

**A:** Currently GetAnswers supports Gmail, Outlook, and IMAP/SMTP. Hey.com uses proprietary protocols.

**Recommendation**: If you're committed to Hey.com's workflow, GetAnswers may not be the right fit. Our customers typically use Gmail or Outlook for maximum automation compatibility.

---

2. **Domain exclusions**: Exclude entire domains (e.g., @legal.company.com)
3. **Keyword filters**: Exclude emails containing sensitive keywords
4. **Folder/label rules**: Only process specific folders

**Example configuration:**
```
Exclude from AI:

## Trust & Control

### Q: What if the AI writes something wrong or offensive?

**A:** Multiple safety layers:

**Layer 1: Approval Queue** (default)
- Every AI response goes to approval queue
- You review before sending
- Click approve, edit, or reject

**Layer 2: Confidence Scoring**
- AI rates its own confidence (0-100%)
- Low confidence → Always flagged for review
- High confidence → Can be auto-sent (if configured)

**Layer 3: Risk Assessment**
- Automatic categorization: Low / Medium / High risk
- High-risk emails always require manual review
- Examples: Legal, financial, first-time senders

**Layer 4: Learning from Edits**
- When you edit AI responses, it learns
- Patterns improve over time
- Your writing style adapts

**Bottom line**: You're always in control. AI assists, you approve.

### Q: Can I trust the AI to handle important emails?

**A:** Start small, build trust:

**Week 1-2: Review everything**
- Let AI draft all responses
- Review and edit in approval queue
- Get comfortable with AI quality

**Week 3-4: Selective auto-handling**
- Configure low-risk senders for auto-send
- Example: Newsletters, confirmations, routine updates
- Still review medium/high-risk

**Week 5+: Autonomous handling**
- 80%+ of emails auto-handled
- Only review flagged items
- Focus on strategic emails

**Trust but verify**: You can always review the approval queue history to see what was sent.

---

### Q: What if I need to take back control?

**A:** Instant override options:

1. **Pause AI drafting**: Temporarily disable (vacation, sensitive period)
2. **Review-only mode**: AI drafts but never auto-sends
3. **Sender blocklist**: Exclude specific people from AI
4. **Emergency stop**: Halt all AI activity immediately

**Data retention**: All drafts and decisions saved for 90 days for review.

You can dial autonomy from 0% to 100% at any time.
